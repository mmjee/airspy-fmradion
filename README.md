### Contributing

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the details.

### No more semantic versioning

The semantic versioning scheme of airspy-fmradion has utterly failed.

New version number scheme: YYYYMMDD-N (N: subnumber, starting from 0, unsigned integer)

### Known issues and changes

* PortAudio is required since Version 20201023-0. Use PortAudio v19. Former ALSA output driver is replaced by more versatile PortAudio driver, which is compatible both for Linux and macOS.
* libvolk is required since v0.8.0. If you don't want to install libvolk, use v0.7.8 instead. Use the latest master branch of libvolk. Configure the `volk_config` file with `volk_profile -b` for the maximum performance. See [INSTALL-latest-libvolk.md](INSTALL-latest-libvolk.md) for the details.
* Building on MacOS 10.15 Catalina is still not tested yet. The development is going on with the last Mojave 10.14.6.
* For Raspberry Pi 3 and 4, Airspy R2 10Mbps and Airspy Mini 6Mbps sampling rates are *not supported* due to the hardware limitation. Use in 2.5Mbps for R2, 3Mbps for Mini.
* v0.8.5 and the earlier versions set the compilation flag of `-ffast-math`, which disabled the processing of NaN. This will cause a latch-up bug when the multipath filter coefficients diverge. Removed `-ffast-math` for the stable operation.
* v0.9.0-test1 to v0.9.5 had calculation error due to `volk_32f_expfast_32f()` in `IfAgc::process()` method. Fixed this by replacing to the more accurate calculation code of `volk_32f_exp_32f()`.

## Prerequisites

### Airspy HF+ firmware

Use the latest version of Airspy HF+ firmware, available at [Airspy HF+ Dual Port](https://airspy.com/airspy-hf-plus/) and [Airspy HF+ Discovery](https://airspy.com/airspy-hf-discovery/) Web pages.

airspy-fmradion sets the default sampling rates to 384kHz for FM broadcast, and 192kHz for the other modes. Old Airspy HF+ firmwares do not support the lower sampling rate other than 768kHz.

### Required libraries

Note: the master branch of libvolk is now required from v0.8.1.

If you install from source in your own installation path, you have to specify the include path and library path.
For example if you installed it in `/opt/install/libairspy` you have to add `-DAIRSPY_INCLUDE_DIR=/opt/install/libairspy/include -DAIRSPYHF_INCLUDE_DIR=/opt/install/libairspyhf/include` to the cmake options.

### Debian/Ubuntu Linux

  - `sudo apt-get install cmake pkg-config libusb-1.0-0-dev libasound2-dev libairspy-dev libairspyhf-dev librtlsdr-dev libsoxr-dev libsndfile1-dev portaudio19-dev`

### macOS

* Install HomeBrew libraries as in the following shell script
* See <https://github.com/pothosware/homebrew-pothos/wiki>
* Use HEAD for `airspy` and `airspyhf`

```shell
brew tap pothosware/homebrew-pothos
brew tap dholm/homebrew-sdr #other sdr apps
brew update
brew install portaudio
brew install libsoxr
brew install libsndfile
brew install rtl-sdr
brew install airspy --HEAD
brew install airspyhf --HEAD
```

## Installing

To install airspy-fmradion, download and unpack the source code and go to the
top level directory. Then do like this:

 - `mkdir build`
 - `cd build`
 - `cmake ..`

CMake tries to find librtlsdr. If this fails, you need to specify
the location of the library in one the following ways:

```shell
cmake .. \
  -DAIRSPY_INCLUDE_DIR=/path/airspy/include \
  -DAIRSPY_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/airspy/lib/libairspy.a
  -DAIRSPYHF_INCLUDE_DIR=/path/airspyhf/include \
  -DAIRSPYHF_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/airspyhf/lib/libairspyhf.a \
  -DRTLSDR_INCLUDE_DIR=/path/rtlsdr/include \
  -DRTLSDR_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/rtlsdr/lib/librtlsdr.a

PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/path/to/airspy/lib/pkgconfig cmake ..
```

Compile and install

## Major changes

### Rate compensation for adjusting audio device playback speed offset

* Background: some audio devices shows non-negligible offset of playback speed, which causes eventual audio output buffer overflow and significant delay in long-term playback.
* How to fix: compensating the playback speed offset gives more accurate playback timing, by sacrificing output audio pitch accuracy. A proper compensation will eliminate the cause of increasing output buffer length, by sending less data (lower sampling rate) to the conversion process.
* You can specify the compensation rate by ppm using `-r` option.
* How to estimate the rate offset: when elapsed playback time is `Tp` [seconds] and output buffer length (`buf=` in the debug output) increases during the time is `Ts` [seconds], the compensation rate is `(Ts/Tp) * 1000000` [ppm].
* For example, if the output buffer length increases for 1 second after playing back for 7 hours (25200 seconds), the offset rate is 1/25200 * 1000000 ~= 39.68ppm.
* +- 100ppm offset is not uncommon among the consumer-grade audio devices.
* +- 100ppm pitch change may not be recongizable by human.

#### Caveats for the rate compensation

* *Do not use this feature if the per-sample accuracy is essential.*
* *Do not use this feature for non-realtime output (for example, to files).*
* Output audio pitch increases as the offset increases.
* Too much compensation will cause output underflow.
* This feature causes fractional (non-integer) resampling by `IfResampler` class, which causes more CPU usage.

### Smaller latency

* v0.9.2 uses smaller latency algorithms for all modulation types and filters. The output frequency characteristics may be different from the previous versions.

### Audio gain adjustment

* Since v0.4.2, output maximum level is back at -6dB (0.5) (`adjust_gain()` is reintroduced) again, as in pre-v0.2.7
* During v0.2.7 to v0.4.1, output level was at unity (`adjust_gain()` is removed)
* Before v0.2.7, output maximum level is at -6dB (0.5) 

### Audio and IF downsampling is now performed by libsoxr

* Output of the stereo decoder is downsampled by libsoxr to 48kHz
* Quality: `SOXR_VHQ`
* 19kHz cut LPF implemented for post-processing libsoxr output
* *Do not use* `SOXR_STEEP_FILTER` because it induces unacceptable higher latency

### Phase discriminator uses GNU Radio fast_atan2f() 

* From v0.7.8-pre0, GNU Radio `fast_atan2f()` which has ~20-bit accuracy, is used for PhaseDiscriminator class and the 19kHz pilot PLL.
* The past `fastatan2()` used in v0.6.10 and before was removed due to low accuracy (of ~10 bits)
* Changing from the past `atan2()` to `fast_atan2f()` showed no noticeable difference of the THD+N (0.218%) and THD (0.018%). (Measured from JOBK-FM NHK Osaka FM 88.1MHz hourly time tone 880Hz, using airwaves after the multipath canceler filter of -E36)
* [The past `fastatan2()` allowed +-0.005 radian max error](https://www.dsprelated.com/showarticle/1052.php)
* libm `atan2()` allows only approx. 0.5 ULP as the max error for macOS 10.14.5, measured by using the code from ["Error analysis of system mathematical functions
" by Gaston H. Gonnet](http://www-oldurls.inf.ethz.ch/personal/gonnet/FPAccuracy/Analysis.html) (1 ULP for macOS 64bit `double` = 2^(-53) = approx. 10^(15.95))

### FM multipath filter

* A Normalized LMS-based multipath filter can be enabled after IF AGC
* IF sample stages can be defined by `-E` options
* Reference amplitude level: 1.0
* For Mac mini 2018 with 3.2 GHz Intel Core i7, 288 stages consume 99% of one CPU core
* This filter is not effective when the IF bandwidth is narrow (192kHz)
* The multipath filter starts after discarding the first 100 blocks. This change is to avoid the initial instability of Airspy R2.
* Note: this filter recalculates the coefficients for every four (4) samples, to reduce the processing load.

### Multipath filter configuration

* v0.7.3 and later: -E36 for 108 previous and 36 after stages (ratio 3:1). The multipath filter order: (4 * stages) + 1
* For reference only: v0.7.3-pre1 and before: -E72 for 72 previous and 72 after stages (ratio 1:1), summary: set the -E parameter to 1/2 of the previous value
* Rule of thumb: -E36 is sufficient for a stable strong singal (albeit with considerable multipath distortion).

### FM L-R signal boosted for the stereo separation improvement

* Teruhiko Hayashi suggested boosting L-R signal by 1.017 for a better stereo separation. Implemented since v0.7.6-pre3.
* DiscriminatorEqualizer removed since v1.7.6-pre3 (needs more precise compensation, presumably with an FIR filter.

### FM deemphasis error prevention

* Teruhiko Hayashi suggested applying deemphasis *before* the sampling rate conversion, at the demodulator rate, higher than the audio output rate. Implemented since v0.7.6.

## No-goals

* CIC filters for the IF 1st stage (unable to explore parallelism, too complex to compensate)
* Using lock-free threads (`boost::lockfree::spsc_queue` didn't make things faster, and consumed x2 CPU power)

## Filter design documentation

## Airspy R2 / Mini modification from ngsoftfm-jj1bdx

### The modification strategy

[Twitter @lambdaprog suggested the following strategy](https://twitter.com/lambdaprog/status/1101495337292910594):

> Try starting with 10MSPS and that small conversion filter (7 taps vs. the standard 47 taps), then decimate down to approx. 312.5 ksps (decimation by 32), then feed the FM demod. The overall CPU usage will be very low and the bit growth will give 14.5 bit resolution.

### Feature changes

* Halfband kernel filter designed by Twitter @lambdaprog is set for Airspy conversion filter
* Finetuner is removed (Not really needed for +-1ppm or less offset)
* Audio sample rate is fixed to 48000Hz

## Airspy HF+ modification from airspy-fmradion v0.2.7

### Sample rates and IF modes

* This version supports 768kHz zero-IF mode and 384/256/192kHz low-IF modes

### Conversion process for 768kHz zero-IF mode
